  |   Nippon Marathon brings its Japanese game show madness!                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Begin, be brave, run... Go! If you extend your muscles firmly...      |
  |   bravely run the marathon race set in Nippon!                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   You can also learn the culture of Nippon while traversing the whole   |
  |   land of Nippon in Wonderland such as urban areas, busy markets,       |
  |   mountaintop temples and supermarkets. (One Stone Two-Bird!) Also,     |
  |   sometimes bad obstacles in the race prevent players from going! You   |
  |   You and your friends should try to avoid barrels rolling in the       |
  |   middle of the road, fruits thrown by other athletes. Aim to be        |
  |   the champion by overcoming all hardships! This is a marathon for      |
  |   Nippon!                                                               |

  |   Featuring a song performance from no other than Diana Garnet, the     |
  |   singer of the Naruto: Shippuden outro, One minute, players are        |
  |   being thwarted by giant fruit - the next, everyone's jumping across   |
  |   trains and Ferris wheels, and the whole thing looks more and more     |
  |   like a crazy Japanese game show every time we see it.                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Essentially, the Story Mode allows you to choose and follow the       |
  |   journey of the four main characters in what turns out to be a mix     |
  |   of racing and visual novel gameplay with numerous chapters. You can   |
  |   see a tease of this one in the final image below.                     |
